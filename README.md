This project was the opporunity to hone __miniLibX__ skills, to make discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.


The term __fractal__ was first used by mathematician __Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974__,
he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".


__A fractal__ is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar
pattern whatever the scale. Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.
